## Introduction

Using Python you very quickly get used to using `import` so you can use other modules within your program, e.g.

```python
from time import sleep
from guizero import App
```

These **modules** have been created by other programmers and often shared as a **distribution** which you can install.

Bundling up code into distributions which you can share is called **packaging** and makes it much easier for people to get, install and use your programs.

In this project you will create a simple Python module, called `motivate` and package it, learning what you need to know to package your own code.
